\begin{abstract}

The aim of this paper is twofold. The first one is to describe a novel research-project designed for building bridges between machine learning and econometric worlds. The second one is to introduce the main characteristics and comparative performance of the first Julia-native all-subset regression algorithm included in \verb GlobalSearchRegression.jl  (v1.0.3). As other available alternatives, this algorithm allows researchers to obtain the best model specification among all possible covariate combinations - in terms of user defined information criteria-, but up to 3165 and 197 times faster than STATA and R alternatives, respectively.
